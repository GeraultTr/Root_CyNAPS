# => Reference: GDs=400. day mm-2

# Coefficient of the life duration (in s m g-1 m3):
LDs = 4000. * (60. * 60. * 24.) * 1000 * 1e-6

# Proportionality coefficient between growth and temperature (in unit of growth per degree Celsius)
# - note that, when this parameter is equal to 0, temperature will have no influence on growth:
growth_increase_with_temperature = 1 / T_ref_growth

# Parameters for growth respiration:
# -----------------------------------
# Growth yield (in mol of CO2 per mol of C used for struct_mass):
yield_growth = 0.8

resp_maintenance_max = 4.1e-6 / 6. * (0.44 / 60. / 14.01) * 5
# => According to Barillot et al. (2016): max. residual maintenance respiration rate is 4.1e-6 umol_C umol_N-1 s-1,
# i.e. 4.1e-6/60*0.44 mol_C g-1 s-1 assuming an average struct_C:N_tot molar ratio of root of 60 [cf simulations by CN-Wheat 47 in 2020]
# and a C content of struct_mass of 44%. And according to the same simulations, total maintenance respiration is about

surfacic_unloading_rate_reference = 0.03 / 12 * 1e-6 / (0.5 * phloem_surfacic_fraction)
# => According to Barillot et al. (2016b), this value is 0.03 umol C g-1 s-1, and we assume that 1 gram of dry root mass
# is equivalent to 0.5 m2 of surface. However, the unloading of sucrose is not done exactly the same in CN-Wheat as in RhizoDep (
# for example, exudation is a fraction of the sucrose unloading, unlike in RhizoDep where it is a fraction of hexose).
# CHEATING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
surfacic_unloading_rate_reference = surfacic_unloading_rate_reference * 200.

# Maximum unloading rate of sucrose from the phloem through the section of a primordium (in mol of sucrose per m2 per second):
surfacic_unloading_rate_primordium = surfacic_unloading_rate_reference * 3.
# => We expect the maximum unloading rate through an emerging primordium to be xxx times higher than the usual unloading rate

# ALTERNATIVE: We use a permeability coefficient and unloading occurs through diffusion only !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Km_unloading = 1000 * 1e-6 / 12.
# => According to Barillot et al. (2016b), this value is 1000 umol C g-1

# Affinity constant for sucrose loading (in mol of hexose per g of struct_mass):
Km_loading = Km_unloading * 2.

# Expected exudation rate (in mol of hexose per m2 per s):
expected_exudation_efflux = 608 * 0.000001 / 12.01 / 6 / 3600 * 1 / (0.5 * 10)

# => According to Jones and Darrah (1992): the net efflux of C for a root of maize is 608 ug C g-1 root DW h-1,
# and we assume that 1 gram of dry root mass is equivalent to 0.5 m2 of external surface.
# OR:
# expected_exudation_efflux = 5.2 / 12.01 / 6. * 1e-6 * 100. ** 2. / 3600.
# => Explanation: According to Personeni et al. (2007), we expect a flux of 5.2 ugC per cm2 per hour

# Permeability coefficient (in g of struct_mass per m2 per s):
Pmax_apex = expected_exudation_efflux / (expected_C_hexose_root - expected_C_hexose_soil)
# => We calculate the permeability according to the expected exudation flux and expected concentration gradient between cytosol and soil.

# uptake_rate_max = 0.3/3600.*3*0.000001/12.01/6.*10000
# => According to Personeni et al (2007), the uptake coefficient beta used in the relationship Uptake = beta*S*Ce should be
# 0.20-0.38 cm h-1 with concentrations in the external solution of about 3 ugC cm-3.
# OR:
uptake_rate_max = 277 * 0.000000001 / (60 * 60 * 24) * 1000 * 1 / (0.5 * symplasm_surfacic_fraction)
# => According to Jones and Darrah (1996), the uptake rate measured for all sugars tested with an individual external concentration
# of 100 uM is equivalent to 277 nmol hexose mg-1 day-1, and we assume that 1 gram of dry root mass is equivalent to 0.5 m2 of external surface.

# Affinity constant for hexose uptake (in mol of hexose per g of struct_mass):
Km_uptake = expected_C_hexose_soil * 10

# Parameters for C-controlled growth rates:
# -----------------------------------------

# Proportionality factor between the radius and the length of the root apical zone in which C can be used to sustain root elongation:
growing_zone_factor = 8  # m m-1
# => According to illustrations by by Kozlova et al. (2020), the length of the growing zone corresponding to the root cap,
# meristem and elongation zones is about 8 times the diameter of the tip.

# Affinity constant for root elongation (in mol of hexose per g of struct_mass):
Km_elongation = 1250 * 1e-6 / 6.
# => According to Barillot et al. (2016b): Km for root growth is 1250 umol C g-1 for sucrose
# => According to Gauthier et al (2020): Km for regulation of the RER by sucrose concentration in hz = 100-150 umol C g-1
# CHEATING:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# Km_elongation = Km_elongation*10
# Km_elongation = Km_loading

# Affinity constant for root thickening (in mol of hexose per g of struct_mass):

# Maximal rate of relative increase in root radius (in m per m per s):
relative_root_thickening_rate_max = 5. / 100. / (24. * 60. * 60.)
# => We consider that the radius can't increase by more than 5% every day

# We define a probability (between 0 and 1) of nodule formation for each apex that elongates:
nodule_formation_probability = 0.5
# Maximal radius of nodule (in m):
nodule_max_radius = D_ini * 20.
# Affinity constant for nodule thickening (in mol of hexose per g of struct_mass):
Km_nodule_thickening = Km_elongation * 100
# Maximal rate of relative increase in nodule radius (in m per m per s):
relative_nodule_thickening_rate_max = 20. / 100. / (24. * 60. * 60.)


# => We consider that the radius can't increase by more than 20% every day
